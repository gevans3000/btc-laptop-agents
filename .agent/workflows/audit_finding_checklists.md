# Audit: Findings Verification Checklists

Goal: confirm every audit finding includes a verification checklist with exact commands/checks.

Steps:
1) Open AUDIT_REPORT_2026.md and enumerate all findings.
2) For each finding, verify it includes a "Verification checklist" section.
3) List any missing or incomplete checklists with file+line evidence.

Output format:
- Summary (1-2 sentences)
- Missing checklists (table: Finding title | Evidence | Suggested verification commands)
- Notes on consistency (if formats vary)

Constraints:
- Read-only: do not modify any files.
- Cite file paths and line numbers for all findings.
