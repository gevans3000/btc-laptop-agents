# Review

Goal: produce a concise, risk-focused code review report for recent changes.

Constraints: prioritize correctness, security, performance, edge cases, logging, error handling, and style. Reference file paths and line numbers when possible.

Output format:
1) Summary (1-2 sentences)
2) Prioritized issues (ordered by severity, include file:line)
3) File+line references (bullets)
4) Risk rating (low/medium/high + brief rationale)
5) Recommended next steps
